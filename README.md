### Dev notes

Eh first game in python, I have barely ever used python. This project was basically just a means for me to practice some python.
I may or may not add more features in the future specially like local multiplayer or even global if enough people request (which lets be real no one's gonna be playing it anyway lol). Anyways star the repo pls.
